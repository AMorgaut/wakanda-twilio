# Wakanda-Twilio CommonJS module #

This module provides a synchronous SSJS API for Wakanda to use the Twilio services.

Note that I'm very new to Twilio. I thought everything could work with direct payload 
in the REST API but Twilio require sometimes a URL to external instructions written in TwiML. 
The SMS features work without it, but calls require it, so I will add support for TwiML.

## Getting Started ##

```javascript
    var twilio, infos;
    
    twilio = require('wakanda-twilio/index');
    
    twilio.configure(
    	AccountSid, //  Required
    	AuthToken, // Required
    	ApplicationSid // Required for many actions
    );
    
    infos = twilio.account.get(); // get infos about the account
    twilio.sms.send(from, to, message); // send a SMS
```

Note: Wakanda doesn't support yet the automatic call to index.js when require is made on a folder. This feature is out of the scope of CommonJS modules and packages but is widely used in node.js ones. As it make it is really useful, it should be implemented in future versions of Wakanda, meaning that require('wakanda-twilio') will then also work while the above require('wakanda-twilio/index') will remain correct.

## Prerequisite ##

Twilio require you to create an account on their website: https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio

You can start using the API in trial mode, providing an **AccountSid** and a **AuthToken**, but most services will quickly require you to buy some credits and provide a **ApplicationSid**.


## Installation ##

To use the module, copy it in the "modules" folder of your Wakanda application, or of your Wakanda server.



## Currently implemented API ##

* account:
	* getList(), 
	* get([id]), 
	* update([options])
	* creatSubAccount([options])
* notification: 
	* getList([options])
	* get(id)
	* remove(id)
* transcription: 
	* getList([options])
	* get(id)
* reccording
	* getList([options])
	* get(id)
	* remove(id)
	* getTranscriptionsList(reccordingId[, options])
* queue
	* getList([options])
	* get(id)
	* create([options])
	* update(id[, options])
	* remove(id)
	* getMembers()
	* getMember(memberId)
	// still miss dequeueing actions
* sms
	* getList([options])
	* get(id)
	* send(from, to, body)
* call
	* getList([options])
	* get(id)
	* make(from, to[, options]) // still need additional TwiML support
	* modifyLiveCall(id, status)


Note: The returned result is currently the raw result returned by Twilio. 
It should be extended in the future, as to handle the paging in lists or return related objects


## Tips ##

On any of those services, to check if something goes wrong you can test this way:

```javascript
    if (result instanceof Error) {
    	console.error(resultmessage, result.details);
    }
```

## TODO ##

* Add TwiML support to add more actions (say, play, dial, record, ...)
* Implement the missing services (conference, ...)
* Create methods, in the returned result, based on its hypermedia informations
* Handle the paging in lists
* Support more settings like default page size by services
